```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(anchors)
library(kableExtra)
source("../scripts/mock_report.R")
```
I chose this example more as a proof of concept. With more data, the creation of more complex and meaningful visualizations becomes more possible. And I have done many of these more complex visualizations in my classes at school.

We can then break it down further by looking creating a table of item sales specifically.

```{r echo = F}
kable(total_sales_per_item) %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Again I just want to say that this anaylization did not go as in depth as possible. I just wanted to use it as a proof of cencept by attempting to incorporate all methods of a report.
