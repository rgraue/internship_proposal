    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am 21 years old, and am currently a junior at SPU, studying information systems.
      Born and raised in Sammamish, I have come to love the area and have become every
      fond of evo as a retailer for our region. I currently live just north of greenlake
      and am enjoy getting back into the rythym of school. All while trying to get out and
      enjoy the outdoors while I can, whether it be biking, fishing, and or skiing.

      Work experience wise is entirely comprised of two entities; Sambica and
      evo. I have worked the past four summers as at a summer camp on lake
      Sammamish called Sambica working as a boat driver. Working there for as
      long as I did, eventually granted me a lot of responsibility, trust and
      respect. All of which did not come easy, but I loved having it, and worked
      my hardest to keep up my reputation and to keep that respect. I loved
      working there, not only was it fun and I was doing it with my best friends
      , but I was also the go to guy for anything that needed to get done. Which
      that latter of the two was possibly my favorite. My boss and I had a
      special relationship, and I defintilely learned not only boat skills, but
      also life skills on how to be a great employee and how to earn respect
      from employers. After this last summer I reached out and started to work
      part time in the ski shop at evo Seattle. Not only has this been great
      fun meeting people and learning tons, not just about skis. I have
      continued my work ethic, and I believe that if you ask anyone at the shop
      they will attest to it as well. It even as got me as much as a free new
      pair of skis from Frank this last February.

      Currently I am entering my Junior year of collgee at Seattle Pacific University
      majoring in computer scince: information systems. My interests particually lay
      in front end development as well as data analysis. I am excited for all fo the
      topics and challeneges to learn this year, as junior year is typically where
      the rubber really meets the road.
